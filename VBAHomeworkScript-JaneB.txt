'## Instructions

'* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

'  * The ticker symbol.
'Create variable:
Dim ticker_symbol As String

'  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'Create variable:
Dim yearly_change As Double
yearly_change = 0

'  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'Create variable:
Dim percent_change As Double
percent_change = 0

'  * The total stock volume of the stock.
'Create variable:
Dim total_stock_volume As Double
total_stock_volume = 0

'Test if code is working:
'--MsgBox (yearly_change & percent_change & total_stock_volume)

'### CHALLENGES

'1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

'  ![hard_solution](Images/hard_solution.png)

'2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

'### Other Considerations

'* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

'* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

'## Submission

'* To submit please upload the following to Github:

'* A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

'* VBA Scripts as separate files.

'* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
